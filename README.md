# Dice Roller

This is a slash command for Slack and Discord to roll dice.

Probably useless to most people, since it's heavily integrated with a Shadowrun
5E frontend called Commlink, and requires a character built there in order to
use.

The dice roller handles initiative, normal rolls, casting spells,
attribute-only tests, as well as allowing the use of Edge.
